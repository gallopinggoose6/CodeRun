# CodeRun
This is the code for a game that  friends of mine and I are working on.
This game is going to be like geometry dash, but different in many ways, as will be mentioned here later on.
So far, there's a character animation, and some code for jumping.
If you would like to help, please see the issues tab, and create a new issue concerning what you would like to add.

The actual name of this game is "Alpha Echo-16" This name was adopted because the name "CodeRun" is so generic
