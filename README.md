# CodeRun
This is the code for a game that a friend of mine and I are working on.
This game is going to be like geometry dash, but different in many ways, as will be mentioned here later on.
So far, there's a character animation, and some code for jumping.
If you would like to help, please see the issues tab, and create a new issue concerning what you would like to add.

Also, if you come up with a better more unique name for this that is about an anti-virus software fixing a computer and Running
Please list it in the issues section because there is a lot or repositories with the name CodeRun, or CodeRunner
